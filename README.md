## How to use
The time is displayed in binary. Each gray circle represents a 0 and a blue circle represents a 1.
See the example:
![Hours = 001011](http://i.imgur.com/bSCCzrz.jpg)

In this case the hours are 001011, which means 11 in decimal.

![Minutes = 001100](http://i.imgur.com/gOw4uc0.jpg)

The minutes now are 001100 in binary or 12 in decimal.

![Seconds = 010000](http://i.imgur.com/gOw4uc0.jpg)

The seconds are 010000, 16 in decimal.
